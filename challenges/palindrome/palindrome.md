###Problem 1
Write a function called isPalindrome() that returns true or false depending on whether the string is a palindrome.
What is the time complexity for this algorithm?

A palindrome is a string of letters that reads the same forward as it does backward. An example is 'racecar' or 'madam'.

Extension: Make the function recursive.

###Problem2
Largest palindrome product
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
